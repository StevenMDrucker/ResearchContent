Dr. Steven M. Drucker is a Partner and Research Manager of the Visualization and Interactive Data Analysis (VIDA) group at Microsoft Research ([MSR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/)), and an affiliate professor at the University of Washington Computer Science and Engineering Department ([CSE](https://www.cs.washington.edu/)). In his 30+ year career, he has published over 120 academic papers, and filed over 130 patents in topics ranging from graphics and interfaces to information visualization. He was inducted into the SIGCHI Academy in 2019. 

Common threads in Steven’s work are helping people discover meaning from their data, and developing methods for communicating those discoveries to other people. His analysis tools assist in both analytic and intuitive explorations of large datasets by revealing their underlying patterns and structures. His communication tools help people share their insights from this process in clear and enjoyable ways by leveraging storytelling and natural interaction techniques.

Another thread in Steven’s career is his continuing desire to bring his academic results to the world at large by shaping them into practical tools and products. His SandDance project democratized his work on the visualization of large datasets. It has been incorporated into multiple products at Microsoft including PowerBI, Azure Data Explorer, and Visual Studio Code. His Thumbtack project gave people new and powerful tools to organize and act on information on the web. He has demonstrated his work on stage with Satya Nadella at the Microsoft CEO Summit and with Bill Gates at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).

Steven is well known for the diversity of his original ideas, having published research contributions in such diverse fields as information visualization, storytelling, exploratory search, multi-user environments, online social interaction, hypermedia research, human and robot perceptual capabilities, robot learning, parallel computer graphics, automatic and human interfaces for camera control, and spectator oriented gaming. He has received best paper & honorable mention awards for papers in ACM SIGCHI, ACM UIST, ACM AVI, and IEEE VIS. 

He is also an active leader in the academic community having served in roles ranging from Papers Chairs for ACM SIGCHI 2021 & 2022, Paper Awards Chair for ACM SIGCHI 2016 & ACM SIGCHI 2017, Subcommittee Chair for ACM SIGCHI 2017 & 2018, Associate Chair for numerous ACM UIST conferences, IUI conferences, an ACM WWW Conference, and IEEE VIS Conferences, and Sponsorship Chair for VIS 2011, 2012 & 2013. 

Steven received his Ph.D. from the Computer Graphics and Animation Group at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) in May 1994. His thesis research was on intelligent camera control interfaces for graphical environments. He graduated Magna Cum Laude with Honors in Neurosciences from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) where he also worked with the Brown Graphics Group and went on to complete his masters at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at [MIT](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) doing research in robot learning.
